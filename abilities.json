In the case of basic Veil, the effect will be immediately lifted if the Champion uses a Skill that deals damage. With the exception of: Damage inflicted by the Skill that applies [Veil] (if applicable) Passive damage Damage that \"Does not count as a hit\" At the same time, [Perfect Veil] is not affected, no matter what Skills the Champion uses.
