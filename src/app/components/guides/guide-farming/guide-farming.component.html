            <h3>Introduction to farming</h3>
            <p>
                Farming is a daily job in RAID: Shadow Legends.<br>
                You will always be farming for something. This can either be gear, mastery scrolls, potions or food to level up your champions. <br><br>
                <span class="text-primary">NOTE : </span>Farming will always be done on auto. Auto will go faster and save you time and effort.
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="infobox">
                <h2>Campaign</h2><br>
            <p>
                Campaign mode is where you will spend most of the time for leveling your champions and their food.
                This will also be the place where you spend most your time early game. <br> <br>
                Campaign is the best source to level your useable champions and for leveling your food champions.<br><br>
                <span class="text-primary">Chicken Farming : </span> to farm for chickens you will need a farming champion. <br>
                The best farming champions are those with AoE skills. You want to be able to kill each stage as quickly as possible. 
                The idea is you will send this champion with 3 food champions, who will usually die in the first round,
                and then the farming champion will solo the rests of the stage to level up the food. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="text-primary">Best places to farm : </span> In each chapter there are two potential targets for farming. <br>
                The 6th stage will always give the highest experience. However while the 3rd stage gives less experience it does drop shield gear which can be sold on average for more silver than the other gear items.<br>
                If you're light on silver, consider farming stage 3 of the chapter you're on and selling the shields, rather than the 6th stage.<br>
                The most ideal places to farm are <span class="text-primary">Brutal 12.3</span> and <span class="text-primary">Brutal 12.6</span>.

                Dungeons bosses are much stronger than campaign bosses and often require specific strategies to defeat. <br><br>

                 are the places where you can farm for potions which you need to ascend your champions into the tavern. <br>
                Ascension gives a small increasement to your basic stats of the champion. <br>
                But some champions have ablities that are either improved or unlock at 3 stars ascension. <br>

First, everyone will have their turn meters set to 50%, both the boss and your champions (this effect only occurs after stage 7). This means that generally, everyone will get 1 attack before the attack triggers. A portion of his health bar will turn purple. If you can do enough damage to remove the purple portion of his health bar, his attack will be cancelled. If you don't, he will fire off his Scorch attack which is a very strong AoE attack that ignores defense and will place an irresistable stun debuff on your entire party. <br>

                    <p>
                    Fire Knight's Castle is the home of Fyro, the Fire Knight. He drops Fury, Curing, Immunity, Shield, Crit Damage, Frenzy, Regeneration, Stun and Savage sets.<br><br>
                    Fyro is one of the most specialized bosses. If you don't have the right team, you'll be stuck on him, and you won't be able to beat him until you make a team just for him.<br>

                    <span class="text-abilities">[Dazzling Flames]</span> an AoE attack that places a 30% decrease speed debuff on all of your champions.<br>
                    <span class="text-abilities">[Passive]</span>At the start of battle and at the start of every round, he will raise his shield. This shield decreases damage done to Fyro by 80%, blocks any debuffs that are applied, and it cannot be removed by any skill that removes buffs. The only way to remove the shield is to hit it the required number of times. You must hit the shield 5 times from Stage 1-6, and 10 times from stage 7-15 to break it.<br>
                    <br>
                    If Fyro begins a round with his shield unbroken, he will make a bonus attack that also decreases your max hp. He will also heal each round based on his shield's strength at the start of the round.<br>
                    If you don't break Fyro's shield, he is essentially invincible. Unless you are enormous stronger than that stage, you simply won't do enough damage, he'll heal back up, and hit you extra hard.<br>

This attack will revive his minions if they are dead, and, importantly, ignore 50% of your defense for each minion that is alive. This means that if it is triggered and both minions are alive, it will entirely ignore your defense. This attack has a 20% chance of placing a freeze debuff on your characters, which increases by 40% for each minion alive. So if both are alive: 100% chance, though it can be resisted.<br><br>
                        He has two minions. The right minion will place decrease defense debuffs on your whole team, the left will attack and deals moderate damage. The right minion should be focused down every time it is revived.<br><br>

                        Spider's Den is home to Skavag, the Spider, and works very differently from most of the other dungeons. First up, there are no minions before facing Skavag. You will begin fighting her.<br><br>
                        <span class="text-primary">Mechanism : </span> Skavag has 2 active abilities and 2 Passive. <br>
                        <span class="text-abilities">[Venmon Spray]</span> an AoE attack that increases damage by 15% if the target is poisoned.<br>
                        <span class="text-abilities">[Enfeeble]</span>  an AoE attack that has a 70% chance of decreasing turn meter by 30%, and after stage 7, will put the target to sleep if the turn meter is fully depleted by the attack.<br>
                        <span class="text-abilities">[Passive 1]</span> is Healing Assured, she is immune to healing reduction debuffs.<br>
                        <span class="text-abilities">[Passive 2]</span> Her first passive is Spiderling Horde, and is the definitive part of the fight.<br><br>
                        At the start of every champion's turn, she will summon two spiderlings. At beginning of the battle and at the end of each of her turns after that, she will summon 4 spiderlings, to a maximum of 10 spiderlings at once on screen. These spiderlings are relatively fragile (though at high levels have decent amounts of HP) but hit fairly hard (especially when there are 10 of them) and can apply a 5% poison on their attacks, which add up VERY quickly.<br><br>
                        At the start of her turn, she will consume every living spiderling, healing for 3% of her max hp for every one she consumes and permanently increasing her attack by 10% for each that she consumes. If she consumes spiderlings on one round, she will not consume on the next. Life Steal and spells that heal based on damage done will only be 35% as effective against both Skavag and her Spiderlings.<br><br>
                        Spiderling management is crucial to winning the fight. If you ignore them, you had better be able to kill her EXTREMELY fast, or you will lose badly. This is doable (indeed some very high end players focus on enemy max hp hits and just kill her in a few hits), but requires a very high level of gear on very strong champions and is not really a generally available strategy to most players.<br><br>
                        <span class="text-tip">TIP : AoE Champions as primary attack. Speed control. Watch cooldown on consume. Attacks that scale on enemy max HP.</span>
